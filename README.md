# AoC
Advent of Code solutions

Calling `./get_input.sh YYYY DD` copies the template notebook to `/YYYY/dayDD.ipynb` and `curl`'s your input to `YYYY/data/dayDD.txt`. The script assumes you've created the directories `./YYYY` and `./YYYY/data` and exported your AoC session cookie to the variable `$AOC_SESSION`.

**OBVIOUSLY DO NOT USE THIS TO SPAM THE AoC SERVERS WHILE WAITING FOR THE DAYS PUZZLE TO OPEN.**
