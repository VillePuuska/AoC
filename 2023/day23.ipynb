    "Since we need to enumerate all paths in this graph, DFS and BFS both work. There is a difference in how we can keep track of the current path between the two. With BFS, (I think) we need to store the entire path for each path separately while we process them, but with DFS we can keep track of visited nodes globally by using backtracking. The problem with BFS requiring us to store each path is not just that we need to copy the entire previous path when we split our path, but simply the fact that we need to store all paths until they reach the end. This hits the limit of RAM on my machine which obviously slows the algorithm down to a crawl.\n",
